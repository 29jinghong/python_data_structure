first step its web crowling or spidering.
onece you have the data you do index building.
in index building you look at all the pages and check which are most centered of all the pages and what is likned to alot of links.
there is a file called robot.txt that tells search engin where to look in a url/domain and where to not look.
in index building you look at how many words are containd, and how many link its pointing to, to see which link is the most important.
